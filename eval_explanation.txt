I took the idea from the following link below which is cited to implement the evaluation function

https://github.com/erikackermann/Connect-Four 

Evaluation function for depth limited minimax is implemented to calculate the utility value.

Calculation of Utility Value from the evaluation function : 

The higher the utility value then better is the decision of the computer in selecting the respective column.

First it checks for whether it can make a four, then it checks subsequently for threes and then twos. 
Similarly it checks for the highest possible four of the opponent by the below formula :

utilityvalue = (player1_fours*10 + player1_three*5 +player1_two*2) - (player2_fours*10 + player2_three*5 + player2_two*2)

After calculating all utility values, the highest value and the corresponding column mapped to it is 
selected and then the move is predicted.
